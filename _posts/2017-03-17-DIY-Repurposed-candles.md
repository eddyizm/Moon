As a small business owner iâ€™m so grateful for all the support and encouragement that comes my way. A few month back a good friend bought a glass cutting saw so Aries Moon Candles can slowly shift over to re-purposed glass holders. Our intention is to reduce our impact on the environment and offer unique individual holders.  We are working on getting them cut, sanded, filled and ready for your home! Stay tuned and thanks for stopping by.
