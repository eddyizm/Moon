### What is Reiki?

Reiki translates  to ‘Universal Life Energy.’ It is a harmonizing, high vibration, purifying energy that has its own natural intelligence. This energy works on the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual bodies, helping to bring us back to our natural state of well being.

### How does Reiki work?

Reiki is transmitted from the  practitioners hands through touch or hands above the body.  During a Reiki treatment the recipient lays on a comfortable surface while the practitioner does a full body treatment from head to toe.  Reiki flows in one direction which allows the energy to clear, balance,soothe and calm the energetic, emotional and physical body.
