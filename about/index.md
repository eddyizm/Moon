## About
Lula maintains her connection with nature by taking backpacking trips, hiking and exploring the outdoors. She has completed 400 hours of yoga teacher trainings, many years of meditation and training, and received her Reiki Master certificate. Lula is also a hair stylist and for the past 12 years she has helped women tap into their innate ability to transform.

Combining yoga and meditation with outdoor exploration has profoundly shifted Lula’s relationship with her mind and body to conquer addiction, depression, and patterns of negative thinking.

Lula’s mission is to creatively help other women transform from the inside out using many methods of healing. It is her intention to bring out and create more beauty in the world through the art of transformation.
