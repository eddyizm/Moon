## Our Mission

Aries Moon Candles is inspired by the smell of rain in the desert,the cycles and seasons of nature, and the sweetness of connecting back to our source.

It began in spring 2016 by Lula Cervantes, a natural born healer, certified Reiki Master, and yoga teacher. Our intention is to capture scents inspired by nature that are infused with Reiki and Mantras to promote healing in your space. We use high quality phthalate-free fragrance and essential oils, soy wax, lead-free cotton wicks and many unique holders. Set an intention and make a wish before you light your candle!
